This is a C++ program that can apply a variety of image and color manipulation effects to a TGA image.

Admittedly, the way that the user interacts with this is very non-intuitive and requires you manipulate the source
code itself and recompile. I may come back to this project
at some point to clean it up.
Nevertheless, I'll show you anyways.

How to run:
1.Clone this repo and open the visual studio solution file given in this repository.
2. Navigate to project_2.cpp
  youll notice in the main function that it calls a variety of functions to
  perform image manipulation, scroll down to these functions and change the name of the 
  files you want to read in.
  One of these lines is at line 313, the next is at line 314.

  What it will do is that it will take the file(s) and manipulate them according to the function.

  For example, lines 313 and lines 314 mentioned above are in the "multiply" function, these will take
  the images and multiply their values together to obtain a new image.
